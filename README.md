# FCCNs: Fully Complex-valued Convolutional Networks using Complex-valued Color Model and Loss Function


we propose a complex-valued color model and loss function and turn fully-connected layers into convolutional layers. All these contributions culminate in what we call FCCNs (Fully Complex-valued Convolutional Networks), which take complex-valued images as inputs, perform only complex-valued operations, and have a complex-valued loss function.
