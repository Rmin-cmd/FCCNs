# FCCNs: Fully Complex-valued Convolutional Networks using Complex-valued Color Model and Loss Function


we propose a complex-valued color model and loss function and turn fully-connected layers into convolutional layers. All these contributions culminate in what we call FCCNs (Fully Complex-valued Convolutional Networks), which take complex-valued images as inputs, perform only complex-valued operations, and have a complex-valued loss function. Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YGrNPxTg2540XuSWDJJC6LxIJimvt4sb?usp=share_link) to the pre-trained models on ImageNet.
